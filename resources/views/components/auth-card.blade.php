    It's common in our current environment that we bond more with those who
    we have had some sort of acquintance with in the past and this limits us in making newer friends and learning from our diversity.
    <br><strong>Socialyz</strong> is an individual initiated service that helps to take care of this by connecting random
    friends serving at the BWC by meeting over a hangout, dinner or an event and to enable them
    create (stronger) bonds of friendship. <br>It's currently in an experimental phase and we hope it'd serve it's purpose.
